# tida1vm



Based on the work of [DoubleDensity's Tidebox](https://github.com/DoubleDensity/tidebox) and
[tida1vm by @lvm](https://github.com/lvm/tida1vm)

> A complete Tidal musical live coding and audio streaming environment inside Docker

uses `tidal-0.8` and `tidal-midi-0.8`

## Getting started

You can use `docker pull` to get a recent built image for tidal.

```bash
$ docker pull lennart/tida1vm:0.8
```

If you want extra control you follow the instructions below to customize the default tidal image.

### Build from source

```bash  
$ git clone https://github.com/lennart/tida1vm
$ cd tida1vm
$ git checkout 0.8
$ docker build -t tida1vm:0.8 .
$ docker run -ti --rm --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb --name 1vm8 tida1vm:0.8
```

## MIDI Ports

All of them are connected to ALSA "Midi Through".

The [GeneralUser SoundFont](http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php) is a work by [S. Christian Collins](http://www.schristiancollins.com/).  
  
They used to be named based on a particular use, now it's more generic.  
In order to alias any stream, just write in your `.tidal` file, something like:

```
let something = midi4

-- now it can be used as:

something $ n "c d e f"
```

### Custom `tidal-midi` Synths

For `0.8`, I updated the `General MIDI Percussion keymap` module [here](https://github.com/lvm/tidal-midi-gm/) with the idea to integrate it to the rest of `tidal-midi`.

### midithru-connect

There's a small script in the `helper` directory called `midithru-connect` which connects clients to "Midi Through".

```bash
usage: midithru-connect [-h] [-v] [-a] [-c CONNECT] [-d DISCONNECT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         shows the current version
  -a, --all             auto connects all clients available
  -c CONNECT, --connect CONNECT
                        connects a client to midi through
  -d DISCONNECT, --disconnect DISCONNECT
                        disconnects a client off midi through
```
